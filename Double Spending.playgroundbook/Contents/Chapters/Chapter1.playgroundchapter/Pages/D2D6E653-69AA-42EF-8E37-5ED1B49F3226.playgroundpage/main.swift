 # INTRODUCTION TO GOOFY COINS
 
 ## Preface :

 Digital currency (digital money, electronic money or electronic currency) is any currency, money, or money-like asset that is primarily managed, stored or exchanged on digital computer systems, especially over the internet. The digital currency we will focus on, in this playground is **Cryptocurrency**.
 
 ## Understanding :
 1. What is Goofy Coin?
      * Goofy is here from Disneyland to help us understand some concepts relating to cryptocurrencies. Let us assume, he makes Goofy Coins (a type of **cryptocurrency**). The key points to be noted about Goofy Coin are:
               a. Only Goofy can create new coins
               b. Coin owners can pass on this coin by calling the pay function
 
 2. Why are we using two keys for every user? üóù
      * Private keys are like digital signatures (or passwords). Only we know our private keys.
      * Public keys are like bank account numbers, you share them so others can deposit money to your account.
