 # CONCLUSION
 
 Yayay!! ðŸ¥³ You made it to the end of this playground. Hope you learnt something new about Double Spending and how to solve it. We still have a little problem though.
 
 ## Understanding:
1. What if our Scrooge was dishonest?
      * If the Scrooge is dishonest, it might validate transactions that use coins that are already spent, i.e. **allow Double Spending**
      * It could also invalidate your valid transactions
 2. How to fix it?
      * To fix this, we can use a Peer-to-Peer network that collectively validates each transaction. How? By a majority rule. The transactions that are validated by equal to or more than 51% of all the people on the network, is considered valid else invalid. This solution was proposed by **Satoshi Nakamoto** in 2008 in his paper *Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System*. Since then, this solution is widely adopted in the implementation of various cryptocurrencies.
 
 NOTE: **Bitcoin** was the first cryptocurrency released in 2009
 
 ## To Do:
  1. Run the playground
 
 ## Conclusion
 
 We learned what is **Double Spending**, loopholes in Goofy and Scrooge  coins and how **Bitcoin** overcomes them. Can you think of loopholes in Bitcoin?
 
 ( **HINT:** Who makes sure the network is honest? )
